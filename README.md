## Lessons Learned

Building this application, I learned about the Spring Boot framework and the N-tier architecture pattern. I specifically used a controller, service, repository, and model layer for my server. In addition, this continued to help me build on my OOP skills. I also used IntelliJ as my IDE for server-side development and found it to be a powerful IDE for Java. In addition, I have only worked with React a little recently. I found it a good reminder of how enjoyable working in React is for meâ€”specifically, the component-based approach I enjoy and producing clean, modular code.

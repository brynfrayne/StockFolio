## Lessons Learned

Building this application, I learned about the Spring Boot framework and the N-tier architecture pattern. I specifically used a controller, service, repository, and model layer for my server. In addition, this continued to help me build on my OOP skills. I also used IntelliJ as my IDE for server-side development and found it to be a powerful IDE for Java.
